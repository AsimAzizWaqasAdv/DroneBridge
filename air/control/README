Build using: "cmake ." followed by "make"

example:
sudo control_rx -n wlan0 -u /dev/ttyAMA0 -m m -c 11:22:33:44:55:66

-n    network interface to use for communication
-u    serial interface (USB) connected to flight controller. FC has to have MSP enabled on this one
-m    mode - can be "w" for wifi (not supported yet) or "m" for long range communication using monitor mode
-c    MAC address of the network interface used on the groundstation to send commands. Used as an ID. Only packets from this MAC will be accepted

Wifi interface must be in monitor mode.
Use: 
interface='<name_of_interface>'
ip link set $interface down
iw dev $interface set type managed
ip link set $interface up
iw dev $interface set bitrates legacy-2.4 54
ip link set $interface down
iw dev $interface set type monitor
ip link set $interface up
# 2437 CH6
# 2462 CH11 etc.
iw dev $interface set freq 2462

The upper step usually gets done by wifibroadcast
