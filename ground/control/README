Build using: "cmake ." followed by "make"

example:
control_tx -n wlan0 -j 0 -d 11:22:33:44:55:66 -m m

-n    interface to send on (must be in monitor mode with option -m m)
-j    index of joystick interface
-d    MAC address of wifi interface on drone that should receive the control commands
-m    use <m> for monitor mode and <w> for wifi mode (not supported yet)

known issues and future improvements:
 - calibration is hardcoded into "parameter.h"
 - xbox controller not supported yet
 - transmit data rate is hardcoded into radiotap header (1Mbit)
