Build using: "cmake ." followed by "make"

example:
sudo control_rx -n wlan0 -u /dev/ttyAMA0 -m m -c aabbccdd

-n    network interface to use for communication
-u    serial interface (USB) connected to flight controller. FC has to have MSP enabled on this one
-m    mode - can be "w" for wifi (not supported yet) or "m" for long range communication using monitor mode (wifibroadcast)
-c    communication id. Has to be the same on drone and groundstation

Wifi interface must be in monitor mode. If not using Wifibroadcast images use the following:
interface='<name_of_interface>'
ip link set $interface down
iw dev $interface set type managed
ip link set $interface up
iw dev $interface set bitrates legacy-2.4 54
ip link set $interface down
iw dev $interface set type monitor
ip link set $interface up
# 2437 CH6
# 2462 CH11 etc.
iw dev $interface set freq 2462
